# ADM-HW2
## Content:
>- functions.py: a script in python containing most of the functions used in the notebook;
>- main.ipynb: the jupyter notebook with the actual analysis of the data sets posts.csv, profiles.csv and locations.csv;
>- commandline.sh: a script in bash that solves an exercise in parsing the posts data above in much the same way as we have already done in python;
>- ADMP10.png and ADMP13.png: two images for a better comprehension of AQ1 and AQ2 questions.

## PLEASE NOTE
On 2 November 2022 we have committed 3 new files (as agreed with the professors via email) containing:
>- the python script with the functions
>- the images for exercises AQ1 and AQ2. 

The scripts were already runned and the solutions already shown in the notebook itself. We also decided not to change the path for displaying these images so as not to affect the main.ipynb notebook and to show that the solutions were actually already present in our homework before the commit in question.
